1. **Home screen:** Home screen includes three lists, Trending movies, Top rated movies, and the movies being played now with their poster and movie names.
2. **Watch List Screen :** This screen includes all the movies added to the watch list, this list should persist after closing the app, i.e. after re-opening the app, the list should stay intact

TMDB API has been used to fetch the data that updates itself in real time.
